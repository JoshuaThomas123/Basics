These are the basics of java written within questions.
Q1) This is the most simplistic way to make a output,or you can do System.out.print(which leaves no spacing throughout each print).
Q2)These are basic internal input variables:String(words), int(whole numbers),float(single bits within a number), char(only stores one letter such as a,A),boolean(true or false variable),byte( 8 bit integer),short(16bit integer),double(high bit integer).
Q3)if/else statements, are conditions were if one is false then the next is checked then else, if all are not true, command in a else loop is activated.This can be used in nested if loops, or in multiple if-ifs/else loops.
Q4)Switch statement, are similar to if/else statements but are more efficient at doing multiple if statements.
