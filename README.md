These are the basics of java written within questions.
Q1) This is the most simplistic way to make a output,or you can do System.out.print(which leaves no spacing throughout each print).
Q2)These are basic internal input variables:String(words), int(whole numbers),float(single bits within a number), char(only stores one letter such as a,A),boolean(true or false variable),byte( 8 bit integer),short(16bit integer),double(high bit integer).
Q3)if/else statements, are conditions were if one is false then the next is checked then else, if all are not true, command in a else loop is activated.This can be used in nested if loops, or in multiple if-ifs/else loops.
Q4)Switch statement, are similar to if/else statements but are more efficient at doing multiple if statements.
Q5) Arrays in java, can be used in other variables and can be used for 1D arrays or 2D arrays(use [][] two different encapsulations) or many D arrays.There are no commands within array but you can print out all of the array or a single string.

Q6)Arraylist in java, is a resizable array(1D) which has it's own special keywords: .add(adding a new variable at the end),.set(set a new variable at any index),.get(to access a variable by using a index),.remove(remove any variable from the index),.clear(clear all arraylist information)

Q7)Hashmaps in java are stored in key/value, there are also, special keywords to be called:.put(adding a new variable),.get(requested from the key variable),.remove(removing it form the key),.clear(clearing all information),.size(showing how many).

Q8) Hashsets are similar to arraylist but have no duplicates, keywords: .add,.remove,.clear,.contains(if it exists),.size.
Q9)Linklist is similar to arraylist but have more commands: .addFirst,.addLast,.removeFirst,.removeLast,.getFirst,.getLast.
Q10)
